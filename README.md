This report presents a comparative analysis of pneumonia detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), VGG16, and ResNet50 models. Pneumonia, a major global health concern, necessitates timely and accurate detection methods. The study employs deep learning models trained on a large dataset of chest X-ray images to evaluate their effectiveness in detecting pneumonia. It aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of pneumonia identification and contribute to the advancement of medical image analysis. The methodology includes dataset collection, data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation. The results indicate that the CNN model slightly outperforms the others in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The study concludes that while each model has its strengths, clinical considerations such as minimizing false negatives or positives will determine the optimal model for pneumonia detection. Future research directions include the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation and autoencoders for feature extraction.
